## Title of the Project
Neutralis-AI
An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI ethics oversight, confirmation bias detection, and critical thinking analysis for AI conversations.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Neutralis-AI is an ethics-focused MCP server designed to make AI assistants interrupt themselves and challenge user thinking. It turns AI assistants like Claude into philosophical sparring partners who actively contradict comfortable conversations and challenge confirmation bias. The system uses Google's Gemini AI to perform comprehensive ethical analysis, detect biases, and provide proactive ethical guidance. It features a weighted pattern recognition system that learns from previous ethical concerns to provide increasingly intelligent oversight.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Ethics Check: Comprehensive ethical analysis of AI conversations for privacy violations, bias, misinformation, and harmful content.
- Critical Thinking Analysis: Detects confirmation bias and evaluates intellectual rigor in AI responses.
- Ethics Guide: Proactive ethical guidance for complex scenarios and dilemmas using multiple ethical frameworks.
- Ethics Learn: Logs and learns from identified ethical concerns with weighted pattern recognition for future analysis.
- API Key Rotation: Supports multiple Gemini API keys with round-robin rotation for reliability.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10, macOS, or Ubuntu) for compatibility with Node.js runtime.
* Development Environment: Node.js version 18.0.0 or later is necessary for running the MCP server.
* API Access: Google Gemini API key(s) required for AI-powered ethical analysis using Gemini 2.5 Flash model.
* MCP Integration: Model Context Protocol SDK for integration with AI assistants like Claude and Cursor.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of VSCode or Cursor as the Integrated Development Environment for coding, debugging, and MCP integration.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes @google/generative-ai, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, dotenv, and TypeScript for development.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
Neutralis-AI enhances AI safety by providing real-time ethical oversight and confirmation bias detection in AI conversations. The project's integration of pattern recognition and weighted learning enables increasingly intelligent ethical analysis over time.

This project serves as a foundation for responsible AI development and contributes to creating more balanced, critically rigorous AI interactions that challenge assumptions rather than simply agreeing with users.
